# Next JS CDK

A zero configuration Next.js 10/11 build and CDK component for AWS Lambda@Edge and AWS Lambda with API Gateway aiming for full feature parity.

Most of the code originates from [serverless-next](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) which this component will try to keep even steps with.
